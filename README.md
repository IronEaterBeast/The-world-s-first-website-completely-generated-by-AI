# From the author:
After I came into contact with ChatGPT, I was amazed by the development of AI. I was curious about the limits of AI, such as whether it could be used to create a website with complete functionality using only ChatGPT. I believed that no one had done this before, so about 10 days after learning about ChatGPT, I began this work and named it "The world's first website completely generated by AI."

I threw myself into it, treating myself like a porter. I told ChatGPT what I wanted to do and then copied the code generated by ChatGPT into the corresponding files. I can guarantee that 99.99% of the code for this website was generated by ChatGPT, and I only had a very small amount of stitching work. You can find the commands I used at the top of each program file, with PHP annotations in English and Chinese, making it easy for you to verify with ChatGPT.

I spent a lot of effort learning how to communicate with ChatGPT. Initially, due to not finding a suitable method, the earlier code was difficult for me to maintain. However, things got much better in the later stages by trying different methods. I eventually completed the website and developed a set of methods that I will summarize when I have the time.

This is not a very powerful website, but I think that when humans and AI look back on the development of AI and the interaction between AI and humans in several or even tens of years, this website and its code may be an interesting part of it.

# How to install the program? It's very simple:
Fill in the database information in config.inc.php.
You need to have an OpenAI key (apply for it here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and then fill in the key on line 177 of API\runbotapi.php, like $open_ai = new OpenAi('your key here');
